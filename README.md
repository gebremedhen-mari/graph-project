# GraphprojectApp

 A fun and interactive Java project that implements:  
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)  
- DFS (Depth-First Search)  
- Dijkstra's shortest paths  
- All paths between two nodes  

## Features

- Supports **weighted and unweighted graphs**  
- Input your graph through the console for dynamic testing  
- Includes detailed examples and sample outputs  

## How to Run
